          <h3>Blurb</h3>
          <p>Here's what makes this one different:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>'Grinding' is impossible or pointless.</li>
            <li>No experience points, the game advances when you face new challenges, not when you collect kills or equipment.</li>
            <li>A very limited inventory that makes stockpiling impossible. Choosing what gear to keep and what to discard is a major strategic choice in the game.</li>
            <li>A steep 'ramping' of power levels and an aggressive hunger clock makes the game fast-paced.</li>
            <li>Each level is different in flavor in strategy, to make advancing interesting. (You advance by visiting different locales, not by incrementing a number.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The idea is to make a roguelike game that is skewed much more towards a board or strategy game than a role-playing game. There's very little role-playing, but a lot of square counting and strategic choice.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="winning">
          <h3>Winning the game</h3>
          <p>Winning the game is deceptively simple: all you need to do is find the Ring of Power and return it to the Astral Throne. However, there are caveats:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is one and only one Ring of Power in the game, regardless of the number of concurrent players.</li>
            <li>The Ring of Power will stay where you left it, regardless of when or who is playing.</li>
            <li>When the Ring of Power is in possession of a player, it grows in malignancy. The more malignant is the Ring, the more is affects your player's hunger stat.</li>
            <li>The only way to "reset" the Ring's malignancy is by destroying it; you can destroy it at any time, but destroying the ring will make it impossible to win the game for the next two hours.</li>
            <li>If the ring is destroyed it will regenerate on dungeon level 1 after two hours. The Ring will alse regenerate if it is in possession by a player for more than two hours.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Ring's current status, monitored online:</p>

          <script id="ringstatus_tmpl" type="text/html">
            {{#regenerate}}
            <p><span class="label">Ready to regenerate on dungeon level 1.</span></p>
            {{/regenerate}}
            {{#destroyed}}
            <p><span class="label">Destroyed or in possession since {{ts}}.</span> 
              <span class="label">({{minutes}} minutes left until regeneration.)</span></p>
            {{/destroyed}}
            {{#found}}
            <p><span class="label">Found somewhere on dungeon level {{dlev}} ({{branch}}).</span>

          <h3>Development notes</h3>
          <p>The game is written in pure C++11, for maximum performance and portability. Some highlights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimal system dependencies. Only a C++11 compiler (tested with gcc) and BSD sockets are required. Should compile and run even on exotic systems.</li>
            <li>Optimized code. The game is developed and tested on slow machines for a smooth playing experience.</li>
            <li>Text-only. Use a telnet client as the interface. (Does not require a GUI!)</li>
            <li>Highly moddable. Most of the game can be changed by editing special plain-text config files.</li>
            <li>Multi-player features out of the box. Install on a public server with minimal hassle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The game is open-source. Download the sources from <a href="http://bitbucket.org/caveadventure/incavead">http://bitbucket.org/caveadventure/incavead</a>.</p>
          <p>The source for the included telnet client implementation can be found <a href="http://bitbucket.org/caveadventure/tiletel">here</a>.</p>

            <li>Other bugfixes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>2014-02-02</b>:</p><ul>
            <li>Turned the Temple of Midas into a full-service store and bank, based on a complex deflationary economy. 
              <ul>
                <li>You can now do four things in a Temple of Midas: purchase protection, as before, deposit to a bank account, withdraw from a bank account, or buy items. (Buying works similar to wishing, except for a price.)</li>
                <li>There is a fixed amount of money in the game. When money is spent or deposited, the amount of money in the game decreases.</li>
                <li>As the money supply deflates, the prices of things become lower. Thus, it is in your interest to hoard money by depositing it in accounts.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, this means that eventually the markets will crash when there is no more money in the game. When this happens the supply counters are reset. During the crash all bank accounts are wiped, too; be careful.</li>
                <li>As demand for items goes up, so will the price, to compensate for the deflation.</li>
                <li>The Temple will accept gems in lieu of money as payment, but the price of gems will fluctuate similar to the prices for items.</li>
                <li>Your bank accounts are anonymous and are identified by a 3-digit PIN code. If somebody figures out your code they can steal your money; likewise, if you forget your code you won't be able to access your account.</li>
                <li>Different Temples will have different rates, so shop around if you can.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Made wishing wells much less powerful and not so abusive.</li>
              <li>Shields provided by protection are now limited, regardless of how much you want to spend.</li>
              <li>Money is now buried in graves, not lying next to them. You'll need to dig into a grave to take the money.</li>
              <li>There are now valuable gems laying about freely in the dungeons, but <em>only</em> if you follow the tunnels to other branches.</li>
              <li>Bugfixes, interface improvements and a few more useful items and strategies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>2014-01-26</b>:</p><ul>
            <li>You can now dig down to search for treasure. (But find a dowsing rod first to help you.)</li>
            <li>Defiling graves is also possible now.</li>
            <li>Implemented toggleable color schemes in menus.</li>
            <li>You can now scroll the screen in spectator mode.</li>
            <li>Lots of critical bug- and exploit fixes.</li>
            <li>Reworked the Lune level a bit.</li>
