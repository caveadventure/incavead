What you will need
------------------

To compile this game you will need

a) A C++11 compiler. (Tested with gcc 4.7 and above.)

b) A build environment that supports POSIX. (Though only a small subset is needed; mostly the socket functions.)

c) Optionally: CMake

d) Optionally, if you want to change the config file syntax: the "ragel" tool, http://www.complang.org/ragel/.


How to build
------------

Simple instructions, for a reasonably UNIX-like OS:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install prefix>
 $ make install


How to play
-----------

a) Change directory to where the 'incavead' binary was installed.
b) Run 'incavead', the game server.
c) Connect with a telnet client to localhost, port 20020.

   Example: "puttytel 0.0.0.0 20020"


Enjoy!
